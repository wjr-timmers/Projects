# Projects
An overview of projects I worked on:
- Rooster Project: Generating a work-schedule using EA-based optimization techniques. (this was in scope with my work at the VU, where I Coordinated the IT Studentenpool) 
- Stochastic Simulation Projects: 3 project assignments I did with a fellow student at the UvA. Topics include Simulated Annealing, Queue Theory and Monte Carlo methods. 
- Vicszek Boids Model - Complex Systems: A part of a group project at the UvA in which I implemented a visual interpretation of the 1 and 2D model for bird flocking. 
- Bachelor Thesis Artificial Intelligence: a project about EA-optimization for Reservoir Networks.
